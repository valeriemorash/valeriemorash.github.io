          <h2>Participate in Research</h2>
          Research participants will be enrolled in research studies for one or more hours, and will be compensated for their time. Research studies investigate materials for people with visual impairments, teachers of students with visual impairments (TVIs), and haptic perception in people who are sighted and/or have a visual impairment.<br><br>
          If you would like to be notified of future research participation oportunities, please email me at val@ski.org

          <h2>Volunteer as a Research Assistant</h2>
          Research assistant volunteers are expected to contribute a minimum average of 10 hours per week, for at least 3 months.

          <br><br>
          Volunteer research assistants will work closely with Dr. Val Morash, while also interacting with other scientists at Smith-Kettlewell. RAs will experience the research process, from project inveption, planning, execution, to reporting. This is valuable experience for anyone who plans to pursue a later career in research or a related field (e.g., research-based policy). RAs will be assigned tasks commensurate with their skills, while provided guidance on building new abilities.

          <br><br>
          Typical activities for RAs include:
          <ul style="padding-left:20px">
          <li>Collecting and managing data</li>
          <li>Transcribing and coding audio/video/handwritten-response data</li>
          <li>Doing literature reviews</li>
          <li>Piloting research studies</li>
          <li>Running human subjects</li>
          <li>Preparing stimuli and instruments for projects</li>
          <li>Programming experimental (Matlab) or analysis (R) code</li>
          <li>Attending research meetings</li>
          </ul>

        During research meetings, RAs are expected to learn about the conceptual and methodological issues related to perceptual psychology and accessibility research. Through their participation, the RA will be learning how to do research first-hand. The RA would obtain skills necessary to move him/her towards being a future independent researcher. 

        <br><br>
        The RA is expected to learn basic research principles at large, and more specific skills related to research, such as: research ethics, research project management, literature reviews, experimental design, data collection, data analysis, oral presentation, and report writing.
