      <p>My research interests stem from the underlying question: how would human cognition and knowledge be different with different senses? In particular, each sense emphasizes certain environmental features (e.g., faces, texture, color, and temperature), and provides a mental framework for dealing with abstract concepts (e.g., visual imagery). I specifically research visual and touch (haptic) perception, and how students with visual impairments understand mathematics.</p>

          <h2>Haptic Perception</h3>
          </br>
          <h3>Haptic Psychophysics</h4>
          <p>Information coming soon.</p>
          <h3>Haptic Movement Trajectories</h4>
          <p>Gathering visual information is characterized by quick jumps in gaze (saccades) interspersed with fixations on features of interest. A question I am examining is whether haptic exploration is characterized by similar movements. This research uses the TMOSS stimuli, finger tracking, and stochastic differential equation models to characterize finger trajectories.</p>
        </br>
          <h2>Visual Imparment</h3>
          </br>
          <h3>Mathematics Achievement</h4>
          <p>Students with visual impairments lag behind their sighted peers in mathematics. In a project with Amanda McKerracher (fellow graduate student), I investigate the cause(s) of this delay. One possibility is that without the visualization abilities that accompany vision, students who are blind struggle to represent traditionally visual mathematical concepts. Initial results from this project suggest that this is not the primary cause of mathematics difficulties, which instead stem from a lack of exposure to mathematical concepts and poorly adapted learning materials.</p>
          <h3>Assistive Technology</h4>
          <p>Students with visual impairments use specialized assistive technology (AT) to access otherwise unaccessible academic material. For example, a student may use a CCTV to enlarge text or may use tactile graphics and braille in place of printed materials. Teachers of students with visual impairments (TVIs) are responsible for obtaining AT and teaching their students how to use it, but acceptance of AT among TVIs is suprisingly low. Despite pre-service training, which is necessary to introduce TVIs to existing AT, a TVI may need to interact with a community that supports and promotes AT to continue learning and using unfamiliar AT. Ting Siu (project lead) and I are currently investigating this possibility.</p>
