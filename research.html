      <p>My research interests stem from the underlying question: how would human cognition and knowledge be different with different senses? In particular, each sense emphasizes certain environmental features (e.g., faces, texture, color, and temperature), and provides a mental framework for dealing with abstract concepts (e.g., visual imagery). I specifically research visual and touch (haptic) perception, and how students with visual impairments understand mathematics.</p>

          <h2>Haptic Perception</h3>
          </br>
          <h3>Haptic Perception & Psychophysics</h4>
          <p>I undertake a large number of projects investigating haptic perceptual properties. Many of these projects compare how people perform at various perceptual tasks, such as search and distance measurement, depending on the number of fingers they use and the number of hands, and if the participants are blind or have vision.</p>
          <h3>Modeling Haptic Movement Trajectories</h4>
          <p>Information coming soon.</p>

          <h2>Visual Imparment</h3>
          </br>
          <h3>Mathematics Achievement</h4>
          <p>Students with visual impairments lag behind their sighted peers in mathematics. I investigate the cause(s) of this delay. One possibility is that without the visualization abilities that accompany vision, students who are blind struggle to represent traditionally visual mathematical concepts. Initial results from my research suggest that this is not the primary cause of mathematics difficulties, which instead stem from a lack of exposure to mathematical concepts and poorly adapted learning materials. This research includes development of achievement and psychological assessments, and is in collaboration with Dr. Amanda McKerracher.</p>
          <h3>Assistive Technology</h4>
          <p>Specialized assistive technology (AT) allows students with visual impairments access otherwise inaccessible academic materials. For example, a student may use a CCTV to enlarge text or a refreshable braille display to access text. Teachers of students with visual impairments (TVIs) are responsible for obtaining AT and teaching their students how to use it, but acceptance of AT among TVIs is suprisingly low. Despite pre-service training, which is necessary to introduce TVIs to existing AT, a TVI may need to interact with a community that supports and promotes AT to continue learning and using unfamiliar AT. In a collaboration with Dr. Ting Siu I am currently investigating this possibility.</p>

          <h3>Cerebral Visual Impairment and Lighting</h4>
          <p>Cerebral Visual Impairment (CV) is the primary cause of visual impairment in North American children. It results from brain damage, and is often related to premature birth. One unusual aspect of CVI is that children have photophobia, and better visual acuity with lower contrast. This latter result has been shown for infants using visual evoked potentials (EVP). Furthermore, anecdotes from practitioners indicate that children with CVI often do best with unusual color combinations, such as red text or yellow text. I am currently working on a project to document lighting effects (contrast and hue) on reading in elementary-school children with CVI. This research is in collaboration with Dr. Amanda Lueck, Dr. Greg Goodrich, and Jasper Ridge.</p>
