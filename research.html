      <h3>Areas of Research</h3>
      <p>My research interests stem from the underlying question: how would human cognition and knowledge be different with different senses? In particular, each sense emphasizes certain environmental features (e.g., faces, texture, color, and temperature), and provides a mental framework for dealing with abstract concepts (e.g., visual imagery, mathematical charts).</p><br>
      <p>My research falls into two scientific areas: (1) haptic perception and (2) visual impairment. As a haptic scientist, my interest in visual impairment is motivated by the extraordinary haptic abilities of people who are blind. As a visual-impairment scientist, my interest in haptics can be explained by the importance of haptic technologies for accessibility. A third area of research is (3) developing methodologies that support my other research, including but not limited to developing finger-tracking technologies, statistical models of finger-movement trajectories, and haptic stimuli/materials.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
          <h2>Haptic Perception</h2>
          <p>The majority of my research projects investigate the characteristics of haptic perception.</p>
          <ol style="padding-left:20px">
          <li>What are the important cues for haptic perception?
            <ul style="padding-left:20px">
            <li>What are cues' relative importance depending on the task and the person’s abilities?</li>
            <li>What part of the hand/arm do cues operate on?</li>
            <li>How quickly can cues be estimated and a value change be detected?</li>
            <li>How is a single cue integrated across the fingers and parts of the hand?</li>
            <li>How do multiple haptic cues combine, and how do they combine with auditory and/or visual cues?</li>
            </ul></li>
          <li>How are exploratory procedures (EPs), specific movement patterns over specific object parts using specific hand areas, used to extract haptic information?
          <ul style="padding-left:20px">
            <li>How do EPs vary depending on the task, cues extracted, and the person’s abilities?</li>
            <li>Are the EPs that are used “optimal,” predictable based on one or another mathematical principle?</li>
            <li>How can EPs be captured, modeled, and predicted?</li>
            </ul></li>
          <li>How does cue perception and EP use develop, change with experience, and differ between individuals?</li>
        </ol>
          <h3>Haptic Perception & Psychophysics</h4>
          <p>Many of my research projects investigate the characteristics of haptic perception using typical perception/psychophysics paradigms. Many of these projects compare how people perform at various perceptual tasks, such as haptic search or haptic distance measurement, depending on which fingers they use and varying if the participants are blind or sighted.</p>
          <h3>Finger-Movement Trajectories</h4>
          <p>Finger-movement trajectories may be as valuable to haptic science as eye movements have been to vision science. Unlike eye movements, where information is supressed during a movement and can therefore be regarded as a series of fixations, haptic perception is most significant during movement. My work investigates how to capture, characterize, model, and predict finger-movement trajectories.</p>
          <h2>Visual Imparment</h3>
          <h3>Mathematics Achievement</h4>
          <p>Students with visual impairments lag behind their sighted peers in mathematics. I investigate the cause(s) of this delay. One possibility is that without the visualization abilities that accompany vision, students who are blind struggle to represent traditionally visual mathematical concepts. Initial results from my research suggest that this is not the primary cause of mathematics difficulties, which instead stem from a lack of exposure to mathematical concepts and poorly adapted learning materials. This research includes development of achievement and psychological assessments, and is in collaboration with Dr. Amanda McKerracher.</p>
          <h3>Assistive Technology</h4>
          <p>Specialized assistive technology (AT) allows students with visual impairments access otherwise inaccessible academic materials. For example, a student may use a CCTV to enlarge text or a refreshable braille display to access text. Teachers of students with visual impairments (TVIs) are responsible for obtaining AT and teaching their students how to use it, but acceptance of AT among TVIs is suprisingly low. Despite pre-service training, which is necessary to introduce TVIs to existing AT, a TVI may need to interact with a community that supports and promotes AT to continue learning and using unfamiliar AT. In a collaboration with Dr. Ting Siu I am currently investigating this possibility.</p>

          <h3>Cerebral Visual Impairment and Lighting</h4>
          <p>Cerebral Visual Impairment (CV) is the primary cause of visual impairment in North American children. It results from brain damage, and is often related to premature birth. One unusual aspect of CVI is that children have photophobia, and better visual acuity with lower contrast. This latter result has been shown for infants using visual evoked potentials (EVP). Furthermore, anecdotes from practitioners indicate that children with CVI often do best with unusual color combinations, such as red text or yellow text. I am currently working on a project to document lighting effects (contrast and hue) on reading in elementary-school children with CVI. This research is in collaboration with Dr. Amanda Lueck, Dr. Greg Goodrich, and Jasper Ridge.</p>
