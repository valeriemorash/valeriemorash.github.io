          <h2>Participate in Research</h2>
          Research participants will be enrolled in research studies for one or more hours, and will be compensated for their time. Research studies investigate materials for people with visual impairments, teachers of students with visual impairments (TVIs), and haptic perception in people who are sighted and/or have a visual impairment.<br><br>
          If you would like to be notified of future research participation oportunities, please email me at val@ski.org

          <h2>Volunteer as a Research Assistant</h2>
        	<p>Students interested in gaining experience in a research setting may volunteer to work as a research assistant with Dr. Val Morash at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute on research related to visual impairment, accessibility, education for students with visual impairments, and haptic (touch) perception. The research assistant may choose to work on active projects according to his/her interest, and would be expected to be contribute about 10 hours per week, for at least three months. Experience gained will be especially relevant to those majoring in psychology, education, computer science, engineering, statistics, or a related field, with an interest in pursuing a research career.</p>
        	<p>
			The goal of volunteer positions is to provide the research assistant with hands-on experience commensurate with his/her current skills, and training to further his/her research abilities. Typical activities that a research assistant may participate or be trained in include collecting and managing data, transcribing and coding video data, piloting research studies, running human subjects, preparing stimuli and materials for projects, programming in Matlab and R, and statistical analysis of results. Research assistants are also expected to attend research meetings, where they can partake in discussions about the conceptual and methodological issues related to perceptual psychology, education, statistics, and accessibility research. The research assistant can be expected to encounter basic research principles and skills, such as research ethics, research project management, literature reviews, experimental design, data collection, data analysis, oral presentation, and report writing.</p>
			<p>
			The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute is located in San Francisco at 2318 Fillmore St., and is reachable by public transportation. Individuals interested in a research assistant position should contact Dr. Val Morash at val@ski.org to enquire about current openings.</p>
